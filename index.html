       <h1>System Design
       </h1><p>
    The Stage will be located in the centre of the room with the audience in the round. Full 4:1 surround
    sound system + Mono centre cluster system will be available for sound output. Each surround system
    will be a high output power line array - not small satellites systems. Mono cluster system will be 4 x
    high output power line array systems- not small in-fill systems. Artists can choose to send audio to
    the surround sound system or the mono system, or both </p>

       <h1>Artist Brief</h1>
        <p>With the performer area placed in the middle of the room and the audience in the round; we are
    seeking artists who are interested in producing new compositions or translating existing performances
    into an extended and immersive presentation format.
    Artists are provided with the opportunity to compose and perform work through a very high fidelity
    surround sound system with enough headroom to allow for very high sound pressure levels.
    In order not to restrict artists to specifically composed 4:1 performances, and to allow for coherent
    playback of non-surround material within the same audience/stage set-up (pre-existing material
    composed for stereo systems…etc), there will be an alternative audio system located in-front of the
    stage edge. This means there is still opportunity for an original audience experience without the
    problem of beats going out of time between distantly placed surround sound speakers.
    These systems, when combined, can be used as a 5.1 system with the centre cluster becoming the
    centre channel, thus giving artists yet more flexibility in composition and performance.</p>
